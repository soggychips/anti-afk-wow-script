# Anti AFK WoW Script

Classic is here, and the queues are long. Stay in game w/ this python script.

This will keep your character moving a little bit every now and then to keep you from getting kicked.

The script uses PyAutoGUI, which manipulates your keyboard. It does not interact with the WoW client at all.

## Requirements

```
Python2.7
pip (2.7)

PyAutoGUI (in requirements file)
```

## Installation (Unix)

```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/soggychips/anti-afk-wow-script.git
cd anti-afk-wow-script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the script (Unix)

1. Launch WoW (Classic)
2. Enter queue
3. Open terminal
   - `cd ~/anti-afk-wow-script`
   - `python run.py`
4. Make WoW the focused window
